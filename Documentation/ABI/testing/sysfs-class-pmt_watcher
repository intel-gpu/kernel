Date:		September 2019
KernelVersion:	5.5
Contact:	David Box <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The pmt_watcher/ class directory contains devices that expose
		sampling and tracing capabilities using the Intel Platform
		Monitoring Technology (PMT) archtecture.

What:		/sys/class/pmt_watcher/smplrX
Date:		September 2019
KernelVersion:	5.5
Contact:	David Box <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The smplrX directory contains files for configuring an instance
		of a PMT watcher device that can perform hardware sampling.
		Each smplrX device has an associated /dev/smplrX device node.
		This node can be opened and mapped to access the resulting
		sample data. The registers to be sampled are determined from
		an XML file of specified guid for the parent device. Programs
		use this XML file to determine which registers to sample by
		selecting the corresponing bit in the "vector" file.

What:		/sys/class/pmt_watcher/trcrX
Date:		September 2019
KernelVersion:	5.5
Contact:	David Box <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The trcrX directory contains files for configuring an instance
		of a PMT watcher device that can perform hardware tracing.
		The associated /dev/trxrX node is only a place holder for
		the device. File operations cannot be performed on it. The
		resulting trace data is placed in the destination specified by
		the "destination" file. The registers to be traced are
		determined from an XML file of specified guid for the parent
		device. Programs use this XML file to determine which registers
		to sample by selecting the corresponing bit in the vector file.

What:		/sys/class/pmt_watcher/.../guid
Date:		September 2019
KernelVersion:	5.5
Contact:	David Box <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RO) The guid for this watcher device. The guid identifies the
		version of the XML file for the parent device that should be
		used to determine the register layout.

What:		/sys/class/pmt_telem/.../mode
Date:		September 2019
KernelVersion:	5.5
Contact:	David Box <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RW) The operating mode of the sampler/tracer. Modes are one
		of the following:

			disabled:	Not operational
			oneshot:	One sample or trace
			periodic:	Periodic sampling or tracing

		mode select works as follows:

		Selecting a non 'disabled' mode will automatically start the
		sample/trace according to the options selected in the other
		configuration files (period_us, vector, destination, and token,
		as applicable). This files will also become read only until
		mode is set back to 'disabled'.

Date:		September 2019
KernelVersion:	5.5
Contact:	David Box <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RW) Bitmask representing the selected metrics to be sampled or
		traced. Programs correlate the regiter to be sampled with the
		bit position by using the XML file. Each bit represents a 64 bit
		register to sample. This file is only writable when mode is set
		to 'Disabled'

Description:
		(RW) Comma separated list representing the selected metrics to
		be sampled or traced. Sample IDs are matched to registers based
		on the XML file. Each ID represents a 64 bit register to sample.
		This file is only writable when mode is set to 'Disabled'
